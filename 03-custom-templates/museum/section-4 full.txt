## You can force an image to extend the edge of the layout regardless of its natural width by adding `full` to the file name.<br> You may have noticed that your cursor changed when you hovered over this section. You can set an entire section to be a link – maybe you want create a subpage for this project – by adding a bookmark file to your site folder and giving it the same filename as the image/caption files.
