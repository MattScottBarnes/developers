## How to use it

First, you’ll need a [Small Victories](http://smallvictori.es/) (and Dropbox) account.

1. Create a new Small Victories site, and choose the Feed* theme.
1. Download the [Bindery Demo files](https://github.com/smallvictories/developers/tree/master/03-custom-templates/sv-bindery), which contains all the starter files you need.
3. Drag these files into your new SV site folder. When you refresh the site, you should see it looks like a book!
4. Replace** the content with your own. You can use images (or really any file types), multiple files, a single file – experiment! (Other than Bindery, [it works just like any SV site](https://docs.smallvictori.es/).)
4. The `_sv_custom.js` file has some stuff in it you shouldn’t touch, but this is also where you can customize your Bindery settings (and you can write your own custom JS if you want). For more information on Bindery, [check the docs](https://evanbrooks.info/bindery/).
5. Design your book using the `_sv_custom.css` file.

*In the future we may release version that work with other themes, but this was developed for the [Automatic Book Workshop](https://www.jacobheftmann.com/teaching/automatic-book-workshop).

**You must leave in `00a-bindery.html` and `00b-bindery-controls.html` no matter what – don’t touch them!
