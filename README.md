# Small Victories Developer Resources

These are resources for customizing the functionality and appearance of a Small Victories website. They range from easy to more advanced – some are drag-and-drop and some require some coding. They’re all meant to extend the basic functionality of Small Victories to allow you to build customized, full-function websites for personal, enterprise, or client uses.

If you’re looking for help with basic Small Victories stuff like setting up a custom URL, ordering and naming files, adding captions to images, or using individual themes, check out the Small Victories [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.smallvictori.es).

There are three main ways to customize a Small Victories website.

## 1. Customizing a Default theme
Default themes are the standard themes built into Small Victories. For more info on the default themes, go the Themes page.

## 2. Using a Custom theme
Custom themes are themes built by the SV community. By following the instructions included in the `README`, you can use the theme in your own SV sites. You can also add your own further modifications to a Custom theme.

## 3. Building your own theme

## 4. Hosting your own code
