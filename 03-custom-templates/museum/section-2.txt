# Image sizing

## By default, images will span 100% of the layout width (but not exceed its natural width).<br>On screens larger than 768px, the title and description will each be half the layout width. Use tags (e.g. `<h1>`, `<p>` — it doesn’t matter what the tags are) to separate text into two columns.
